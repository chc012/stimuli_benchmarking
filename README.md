# My Phaser 3 + TypeScript Boilerplate

Many thanks to Joe Bustamante (https://spin.atomicobject.com/2019/07/13/phaser-3-typescript-tutorial/) for providing the starter kit.

- Loading screen, main menu screen, and an sprite that can be moved around with the arrow keys.
- Use Phaser 3.50 and TypeScript 4.1.

## How to Use

- `yarn install` to get any of the necessary dependencies.
- `yarn dev` and the game should begin to run.
- `localhost:8080` (by default) to see the "game".

Running `yarn dev` runs the game in development mode, which produces larger bundle sizes but compiles faster and provides better debug support.
